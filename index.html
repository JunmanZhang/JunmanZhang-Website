        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I’m a freshman in art history and minor in communication at UC Riverside. I have a strong interest in the job of Museum marketing and public relations. I’m especially interested in Chinese art history. My family immigrated to the US when I was twelve years old that I have been studying in the US. However, due to the influence of my family, I have a strong interest in Chinese culture and history. I studied Western art history in my freshman year, and found that I was very interested in learning the history through a cultural relic. China is a country with more than 5,000 years of history, and the Forbidden City is one of the most famous museums in the world.<br>

        <br> What’s more, during the summer of 2018, I had an educational opportunity to visit the Lei Feng museum in China and had the honor to interview one of Lei Feng’s friends. As Lei Feng is a great man in the Chinese culture where people nowadays still use him as a role model to look up to. After the visit of the Lei Feng museum, I believe there are many other great men in the Chinese history which shaped who we are today. Furthermore, I have been influenced by Chinese culture since I was young and I heard a lot of Chinese history stories from my parents. <br>

        <br> During the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work with the national palace museum in Beijing China to work with children in class and teach them about the history behind each palace in the forbidden city. I was there for two month and I not only thought about the children so much about the Chinese culture but also learned more things from my co-workers. I met many interesting people at work and I was able to listen to their experience and their studies in their field of study. I also enjoyed working with these children and even more sure that this is the job I want in the future. My goal is to spread the Chinese culture all around the world by using what I have learned. <br>
        <br> I also have experience in communication, I work at a coffee shop as a cashier on a regular basis. I have experience of talking with different types of people and is very outgoing. Through this job, I earned the ability to read people’s faces, and say what they want to hear instead of explaining why they want to me talking. I also learned to see my mistake and apologized to my client when I made a mistake. Through this job I became more reliable and responsible for my own tasks. I’m also good at making pervasive statements when my client doesn't know what to order, I can make suggestions based on his/her needs. Through this job I hope that I can spread more Chinese culture to the world.<br>
